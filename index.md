Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&CS program at Bocconi University, where I had been advised by [Luca Trevisan](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/) until mid of 2024, lately I have been co-advised by [Alon Rosen](https://www.alonrosen.net/) and [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/).

I am interested in questions motivated by the theory of computing, meaning that they are concerned with *algorithms* and *computational complexity*.

In particular, recently I have been thinking about questions related to

* spectral and algebraic graph theory
* applications of linear/semidefinite programming to algorithm design, especially the sum-of-squares method.
