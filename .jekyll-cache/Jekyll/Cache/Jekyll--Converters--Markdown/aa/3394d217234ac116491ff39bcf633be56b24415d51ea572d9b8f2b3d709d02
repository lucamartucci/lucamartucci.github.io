<p>These notes will mostly focus on proofs and discussions. Each part may cover discussion on an interesting topic. The collection of material referred can be found in the first notes.<br />
<strong>Disclaimer.</strong> Some of the proofs are constructed by myself and donâ€™t necessarily follow the proof in the original references.<br />
