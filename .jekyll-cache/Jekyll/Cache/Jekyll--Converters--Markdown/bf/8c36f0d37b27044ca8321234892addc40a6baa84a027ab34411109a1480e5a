I"î<p>Hi! I am a PhD student in the Stat&amp;CS program at Bocconi University, where I have the good fortune to be advised by <a href="https://lucatrevisan.github.io/"><em>Luca Trevisan</em></a>. Previously I studied at UCSB and Rutgers University, Iâ€™m grateful to the professors who taught and helped me there.</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2>

<p>In general I like interesting mathematical problems with motivation from computation, which are usually tagged with Algorithms, Computational Complexity Theory, Pseudorandomness.</p>

<p>I also have a growing interest in projects that aim at closing the gap between theory and practice, especially in understanding experimental results on real instances, and in developing good heuristics guided by theory.</p>

<p>Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you have interest in discussing.</p>

<p>I especially like the the following introductory chapters about being a mathematician:</p>

<p>I am one of those international students who are (yes, still in effect) prevented from entering the US to join academic activities, mainly by revoking student visas. More specifically, this is due to the <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/proclamation-suspending-entry-chinese-students-and-researchers-connected-prc">Proclamation 10043</a>. Besides its unclear definition of â€˜military-civil fusion strategyâ€™ and its misidentification of students in execution, I donâ€™t see any valid reasons behind this policy.</p>
