<p>Turing-endorsed typewriters.</p>

<p>I wondered the shop owner had just related typewriters to Turing machines by imagination. However, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Wikipedia</a> it writes:</p>

<p>“… Turing had a lifelong interest in machines: “Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; [his mother] Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter ‘mechanical’” (Hodges p. 96). While at Princeton pursuing his PhD, Turing built a Boolean-logic multiplier …”</p>

<p>Maybe Turing did had some inspiration from typewriters.</p>

<p>However he doesn’t receive compensation from this endorsement.</p>
