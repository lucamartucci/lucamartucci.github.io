* **Deep learning Sumerian translation and recognition** ([pdf](SuBERT.pdf), [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>]([https://github.com/lucamartucci/NBAstat](https://github.com/sstraccialini/AI-project-SuBERT)))

  Image-classification techniques to isolate and recognize individual characters from high-resolution tablet images written in Sumerian cuneiforms and translation via Transformer-like architectures.

* **Gene-based classification of Hypoxia in cancer cells** ([code]())
  
  Machine Learning models for the classification of the state of hypoxia in cells, involving dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), supervised and unsupervised learning (clustering, KNN, XGBoost, SVM, NN), hyperparameter optimization (Optuna), encoding, and ensemble models.

* **Monte Carlo simulation of the 3-dimensional Ising model** ([code]())
  
  Simulation of the Ising model on a 3D lattice using the Metropolis algorithm. Analysis of phase transitions and
magnetization behavior near the critical temperature.

* **Evolutionary algorithms to find minimal surfaces** ([code]())
  
  Computing solutions to the plateau problem with fixed volume and Dirichlet boundary condition in the plane,
using various evolutionary computing selection and variation operators.

* **Analysis of JENGA using Game Theory** ([pdf](Jenga.pdf))
  
  Subgame perfect equilibria for a model two-player JENGA match, and the influence of playersâ€™ risk behavior on
their strategy profiles.

* **Pilot Machine Learning project** ([code]())
  
  End-to-end pipeline for sample data to perform a multiclass classification task, involving data scaling, cleaning,
and visualization, dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP) and a comparison of the results of different models.

* **What makes a winning NBA team?** ([pdf](What makes a winning NBA team?.pdf), [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/lucamartucci/NBAstat))
  
  Data analysis of teams statistics, for the 2021-2 and 2022-3 NBA seasons, with the ideal target of detecting the
most relevant parameters influencing the winning percentage of each team.
