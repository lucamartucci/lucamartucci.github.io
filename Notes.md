After rethinking the purpose of writing notes and their readability, I've decided to make some changes. Here are some observations and ideas:

* Make certain details omitted. As a principle, the omitted part should either be an easy exercise, or be be found/learnt via online resources. The ability to prove from scratch, or to search for certain clues and reconstruct proofs should be trained. 

A beginner would write proofs as detailed as possible, for he was unfamiliar with the calculation. It's time to omit certain details as the familiarity increases. Also, with different emphsis on details, the notes are looking messy and the main clues of the proof aren't apparent.
